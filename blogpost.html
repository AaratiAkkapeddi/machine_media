        <h1>Blog Post Assignment:</h1>

        <p>This course covers a lot of ground. Going over different aspects of Machine Learning every week means that we are just scratching the surface. This assignment is an opportunity for you to delve deeper. I would like you to write a (minimum 1000-word) blog post on a topic related to Machine Learning that will be featured on our class website. Make sure you choose a topic that is <em>actually interesting</em> to you. This is not an essay or a report and so I would like you to write from your own perspective. You don’t need to write in an academic or professional tone if you don’t want to. Your post can include images or references to video content. However, your post should still be informed by research and so you need to have at least five citations. While your audience will most definitely be your classmates and me, our class website will live beyond the semester. It is important that you think about your audience as more expansive than just our class. If you would like to remain anonymous on the website, feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss options.
            <p>You must choose your topic by <strong>September 22nd</strong>. Once you've chosen, <strong>you need to share your topic choice <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OxL82zaY0rP5fRZbqi1Q2ZnwqHmUB_hXpWHjKTn7BKE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</strong> (This is to avoid multiple people choosing the same topic)</p> 
            <p>Please submit your blog post as a google doc or text file <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rw8UQiFxdKpaqsRI18VkMayjhcGLG0Rw">in your assignment folder</a>. You can submit your post at any time <strong><em>before</em> December 1st</strong>.</p>


        If you need help thinking of a topic I have some examples below.
        </p>

        <h4>EXAMPLE TOPICS TO EXPAND UPON IN A BLOG POST:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>How Machine Learning is affecting sex workers’ rights</li>
            <li>How Machine Learning is affecting censorship</li>
            <li><a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/lewis-arista-pechawis-kite/release/1">Indigenous Protocols for working with AI/Machine Learning</a></li>
            <li>Machine Learning and Comedy or Machine Learning and Memes</li>
            <li>Write guidelines for how you could use Artificial Intelligence ethically in your practice/field of study.</li>
            <li>How Machine Learning is or isn’t shaping aspects of popular culture (music, online trends, internet slang, etc)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-scientists-are-using-ai-to-talk-to-animals/#:~:text=The%20next%20insight%20is%20that,The%20honeybee%20research%20is%20fascinating.">Animals interacting with artificial intelligence.</a></li>
            <li>AI and agriculture</li>
            <li>Venture Capitalism and AI</li>
            <li>Research a specific big dataset used for Machine Learning</li>
        </ul>
